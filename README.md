## â™¦ Why this app?

This app is for calculating the tip amount of money to pay for the restaurant with the ability to split it between two or more people with ease.

## â™¦ User journey:

- When the user first opens the app, he/she will find a title for the app, and two boxes for calculating the tip amount depending on the bill amount of money.
- On the first box, the user is supposed to fill each input with its value, like putting the bill amount on the input field that is marked with the word `_bill_, then choosing the tip ratio Ù€Ù€ and you can customize you own Ù€Ù€, and finally the number of people to split the amount between.
- On the second box, the result will appear with the tip amount for each person and the total amount that every person have to pay.
- And the last thing is that the user can reset the data to zeros or empty for a new calculation.

## â™¦ User stories:
